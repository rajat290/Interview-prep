Node js is single threaded , non blocking , async, event driven runtie built on chroms v8 engine. 
it uses Event loop to handle multiple operations cncurrently without creating multile threads.

🧠 Easy Explanation
Socho tum ek chai ki tapri (tea stall) chala rahe ho ☕

Ek hi aadmi (thread) sab sambhal raha hai: order lena, chai banana, paise lena

Lekin yeh aadmi smart hai — wo bolta hai:
➤ "Abe tu chai garam hone tak side me ho ja, mai dusre ka order le leta hoon"

Jab chai ready hoti hai, wo chillata hai: "Ready hai bhai!"
➤ Fir wo serve karta hai
Yeh hi Node.js ka Event Loop hai — ek smart aadmi jo sab kaam line se karwata hai bina rukke.

⚙️ How Node.js Works Internally (Step-by-Step):
graph TD
    A[User makes a request] --> B[Node.js receives it]
    B --> C[Check: Is it blocking?]
    C -->|No| D[Process directly & Respond]
    C -->|Yes| E[Send to Background Worker Thread]
    E --> F[Once done, pushes callback in Event Queue]
    F --> G[Event Loop picks it]
    G --> H[Sends result to user]


🔁 Breakdown:
Single Thread: Node.js runs on one thread but can handle many requests

V8 Engine: Converts JS code into fast machine code

Libuv: C++ library that handles thread pool, file system, networking

Event Loop: Heart of Node.js, keeps checking for pending tasks/callbacks

Callback Queue: Stores tasks that are ready to be executed

Thread Pool: For CPU-heavy tasks (e.g., file reading)
