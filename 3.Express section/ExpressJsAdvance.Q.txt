===========================================

ðŸ”¸ Q1. How do you structure a large-scale Express.js project?
Mock Answer:

I follow modular structure â€” separate folders for routes, controllers, services, and models. I use index.js to organize routes. Middleware and config files are isolated. This makes the app maintainable and scalable. I also follow MVC-style separation for clean code.

ðŸ”¸ Q2. How do you implement centralized error handling in Express?
I use a custom error-handling middleware at the end of all routes, with a class like AppError for consistent error structure. All async routes use a wrapper like catchAsync() to forward errors to next(), allowing unified error logging and response.

ðŸ”¸ Q3. Whatâ€™s the purpose of middleware in Express? Can you give real-use examples?
Middleware are functions that run before the request reaches the controller. Examples include: logging requests (morgan), parsing body (body-parser), authentication (verifyToken), validation, and error handling. Custom middleware allows layered and reusable logic.

ðŸ”¸ Q4. How do you secure your Express API endpoints?
Mock Answer:

I use JWT-based auth in headers, protected via middleware. Additionally, I use Helmet to secure headers, CORS for cross-origin handling, express-rate-limit to prevent brute-force attacks, and sanitize inputs to avoid NoSQL injection.

ðŸ”¸ Q5. How would you handle file uploads in Express?
Mock Answer:

I use multer for handling multipart/form-data. I define a disk storage engine or connect it to cloud storage like AWS S3. Then I build a route like /upload with middleware that processes file, followed by controller logic to save metadata or respond.
