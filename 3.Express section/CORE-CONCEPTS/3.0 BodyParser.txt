ody Parser Express.js ka ek basic yet powerful part hai.

🔧 1. TECHNICAL DEFINITION

Body Parser is a middleware in Express.js that parses the incoming request body (usually in JSON, form, or URL-encoded format) and makes it available in req.body.

Earlier it was a separate library (body-parser), but from Express v4.16+ it's already included in Express.

🧒 2. EASY (KINDERGARTEN STYLE) EXPLANATION
Socho ek courier delivery aayi hai 📦

Tumhara server (Express) ek person hai jo parcel (data) receive karta hai

Lekin parcel ka andar kya hai, samajhne ke liye body parser chahiye

⚙️ Body parser kholta hai parcel ka dibba aur andar ka saman (data) req.body me daal deta hai.

📦 4. TYPES OF BODY DATA IT HANDLES
Type	Use this middleware	Example Content
JSON data	express.json()	{ "name": "Ravi", "email": "abc@x.com" }
Form data	express.urlencoded()	name=Ravi&email=abc@x.com

🔐 6. WHY BODY PARSER IS NEEDED
| Without body-parser | req.body will be undefined ❌ | | With body-parser | req.body will give you full data ✅ |

🔥 INTERVIEW STYLE SUMMARY
“Body Parser is a middleware that parses incoming request data like JSON or form data and puts it in req.body. Without it, Express can’t understand what the client sent in the body of POST/PUT requests.”

📌 REAL-WORLD USES
Use Case	How it helps
Signup/Login Form	Get email & password from req.body
Contact Forms	Get user-submitted message in backend
API JSON handling	Parse and use incoming JSON data

🛠 BONUS: OLD WAY vs NEW WAY
Way	Code
Old	const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
app.use(bodyParser.json());
New (better)	app.use(express.json());
