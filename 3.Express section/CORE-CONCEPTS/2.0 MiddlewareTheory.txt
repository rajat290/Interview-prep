Middleware Express.js ka dil hai — bina middleware ke koi bhi Express app adhura hota hai.
Chal bhai, step-by-step breakdown deta hoon 👇

🧠 1. TECHNICAL DEFINITION:
Middleware functions in Express are functions that have access to the request (req) and response (res) objects, and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle.

Middleware ek function hai jo ek Express app ke middleware stack mein add kiya jata hai.
function ek request ya response ko process karne ke liye use kiya jata hai.


Middleware can:

(1). Modify the req or res object

(2). End the request-response cycle

(3). Call next() to pass control to the next middleware

🧪 3. BASIC MIDDLEWARE EXAMPLE:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Custom middleware
const myLogger = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Request method: ${req.method} | URL: ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Pass control to next middleware or route handler
};

// Apply middleware
app.use(myLogger);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Home page');
});

app.listen(3000);


🧾 Output:
If you open http://localhost:3000/, you'll see in terminal:

Request method: GET | URL: /

🧩 4. TYPES OF MIDDLEWARE:
There are three types of middleware in Express:
1. Application-level middleware (app.use())
Description
Added using app.use() or app.get()

2. Router-level middleware (router.use())
Description
Added using router.use() or router.get()

3. Built-in middleware (e.g., express.static(), express.json(), etc.)
Description
Added using express() or express.Router() constructor

 There are Other two more Types of Middleware
 1. Error-handling middleware
 Description
 Added using app.use() or app.get()

 2. Third-party middleware (	Like morgan, cors, helmet etc.)
 Description
 Added using npm install and then require() or import() in your code

🔗 6. CHAINING MULTIPLE MIDDLEWARE

const checkAuth = (req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.headers.authorization) {
    return res.status(401).send("Unauthorized");
  }
  next(); // user is authorized
};

const logUser = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("User is logged in");
  next();
};

app.get('/dashboard', checkAuth, logUser, (req, res) => {
  res.send("Welcome to dashboard");
});

✅ checkAuth → logUser → dashboard response

🧠 INTERVIEW STYLE ANSWER
“Middleware in Express.js are functions that sit in the middle of the request and response. They can modify the request object, stop the request, or forward it using next(). They’re widely used for logging, validation, authentication, error handling, and more.”
