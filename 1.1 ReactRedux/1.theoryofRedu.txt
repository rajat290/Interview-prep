🔥 What is Redux?

Redux is a predictable state management library used to manage and centralize application state across components.

It acts as a single source of truth where all state lives in a single global store, and changes to state happen in a predictable way using actions and reducers.

❓ Why Redux is Used?

React ke andar agar teri app chhoti hai (2-3 component tak), to useState ya useContext se kaam ho jata hai.

But when:

App becomes large

State needs to be shared across many components

You need state consistency

Want debuggable and trackable state updates

🧠 Redux becomes very helpful because:

Central store

Clean data flow

Time-travel debugging (DevTools)

Middleware support (for async, logging etc.)

⏱️ When to Use Redux?
Use Redux when:

App has complex or deeply nested components

State is shared between many sibling components

You want strict control on how and when state updates

You need middleware features like logging, API, caching

❌ Don’t use Redux if:

Your app is small

You don’t have shared state

useState or Context API is enough

🧩 Where Redux is Used?
E-commerce: Cart, Filters, Auth, Wishlist, Inventory

Social Apps: Post feed, reactions, user session, modals

Dashboards: Real-time data updates, filters, multi-view sync

🔁 Redux Flow Explained (Step-by-Step with Real Life Example)
Let’s understand with analogy first:

🍕 Example:
Imagine a pizza restaurant (Redux system):

Customer (Component) places an order (dispatches an action)

Waiter (Action) takes the order to the kitchen

Kitchen (Reducer) decides how to update the order queue

Order Board (Store) updates with new order info

Customer sees the updated order status

🧠 Redux Data Flow in Code:

1. User clicks ➝ dispatch(action)
2. action → reducer
3. reducer → updates state
4. component → gets updated state from store

🏗️ Redux Core Concepts:
Concept 	Role
Store	  => Centralized place where the state lives
Action	  => Object describing “what happened”
Reducer	  => Pure function that updates state based on action
Dispatch	=> Function to send action to reducer
Selector	=> Access data from store
Middleware	=> Intercepts actions (e.g., for async like redux-thunk)
